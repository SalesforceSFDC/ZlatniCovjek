# Override Standard Approval Page in Salesforce1

* https://developer.salesforce.com/forums/?id=906F0000000AbeXIAS
  * override the detail pages approval history related list w/ a vf component or override the entire page w/ vf including a custom approval history related list (to hide the approve/reject link) which I'm working on now.
