* The `ng-app` directive tells AngularJS that “MobileFrameworksApp” is the root element of the AngularJS application. All AngularJS applications need a root element.
* The `ng-model` directive lets you bind the value of your input field to a variable.
* AngularJS displays your content from the model using the `{{ yourInput }}` expression, where “Input” is your name, company, phone number, and email.
* The `angular.module('MobileFrameworksApp', []);` call in the JavaScript section of the markup defines the module which contains our AngularJS application. The AngularJS module is a container for functions that run when the application starts.
